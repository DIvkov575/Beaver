## üöÄ **Build**

To get started with Beaver SIEM, you will need to install and build it using the standard tools. Make sure to set up the required environment before proceeding.
```
Cargo install --release --path .
```
‚öôÔ∏è *This step will build Beaver SIEM in release mode. Reload shell after install*

---

### üìã **Current Todo:**

> The following tasks are in progress or planned for the next release:

- **l_0** - crj shutoff - missing `{}` as second arg in the last `.get()` chain method call
- **l_1** - Add SA delegation - destructured log -> BQ - logging

---

### üí° **Ideas for Future Enhancements:**

- Disable `detections_gen.py` regeneration to streamline the development process.
- Implement batching to improve efficiency in BigQuery by deduplicating writes after log destructuring.
  
    üìù *This will help reduce the amount of redundant data being written, enhancing write efficiency.*

---

### ‚è≥ **Current Progress:**

- Create Cloud Run jobs.
- Set up BigQuery.
- Create Pub/Sub topic **(1)** and subscription **(2)** for BigQuery integration.
- Provision storage bucket for log storage.
- Link Cloud Run jobs to storage bucket for secure storage and retrieval.
