### 📋 **Current Todo:**

> The following tasks are in progress or planned for the next release:

- **l_0** - crj shutoff - missing `{}` as second arg in the last `.get()` chain method call
- **l_1** - Add SA delegation - destructured log -> BQ - logging

---

### 💡 **Ideas for Future Enhancements:**

- Disable `detections_gen.py` regeneration to streamline the development process.
- Implement batching to improve efficiency in BigQuery by deduplicating writes after log destructuring.
  
    📝 *This will help reduce the amount of redundant data being written, enhancing write efficiency.*

---

### ⏳ **Current Progress:**

- Create Cloud Run jobs.
- Set up BigQuery.
- Create Pub/Sub topic **(1)** and subscription **(2)** for BigQuery integration.
- Provision storage bucket for log storage.
- Link Cloud Run jobs to storage bucket for secure storage and retrieval.
